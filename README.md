=========

Do you know about all the stress of overwriting variable after variable, just to find out that your framework of choice comes with a \*\*\*\*load of variables, but doesn't use them where you *really* need them?
*Even worse:* You have to redefine classes and overwrite attributes _(if possible)_ to even out the mistakes of the creator of the framework of your choice.


Ever needed a few tools that just doesn't mess around with your style?

Want something that adapts to your way of creating websites?


Well, I realized that no existing solution will serve me well, and neither does this one.
But it became easier and way less mind-devastating to create my own tools and build only on a few handpicked ones.


###TL;DR:
UI-Wrench is a compilation of common CSS tools written in LESS. For rapid development intended.

##No Bootstrap, no Foundation, no Blueprint
_(it's not worth losing your sanity to a framework)_
Through painful months of using SASS and LESS bootstrap for several bigger projects, I decided to create my own tools.
The only component I use from bootstrap is the grid system, and not even that one is ideal for what I want to achieve.
There is no perfect tool that solves every tiny problem, just systems that are "good enough".
Get one-purpose tools only that don't limit you! That's the bottom line.

##JS Tools that work

Finding decent JS libs is exhausting.
You simply can't afford trying and figuring out what lib to use for a simple slider!
Gosh, it's 2014 and we are still struggling to find the right components because either it is too complicated to implement, or it doesn't use the markup we desire.

I included some tools that are easy to extend, easy to implement and well documented.
