=========

Do you know about all the stress of overwriting variable after variable, just to find out that your framework of choice comes with a ****load of variables, but don't use them where you need them?
Even worse: You have to redefine classes and overwrite attributes (if possible) to even out the mistakes of the creator of the framework of your choice.

Ever needed a few tools that just doesn't mess around with your style?
Want something that adapts to your way of creating websites?

Well, I realized that no existing solution will serve me well, and neither does this one.
But it became easier and way less mind-devastating to create my own tools and build only on a few handpicked ones.

###TL;DR:
UI-Wrench is a compilation of common CSS tools written in LESS.

##No Bootstrap, no Foundation, no Blueprint
_(it's not worth losing your insanity to a framework)_
Through painful months of using SASS and LESS bootstrap for several bigger projects, I decided to create my own tools.
The only component I use from bootstrap is the grid system, and not even that one is ideal for what I want to achieve.
There is no perfect tool that solves every tiny problem, just systems that are "good enough".
Get one-purpose tools only that don't limit you! That's the bottom line.
